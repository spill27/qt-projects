# Qt

Qt is a toolkit for creating **Graphical User Interfaces** (**GUI**), as well as cross-platform applications.

Qt makes use of some modules. These modules group related functionalities together. The following lists some modules and what they do:

- `QtCore`: As the name implies, these modules contains core and important classes for the Qt framework. These include containers, events, and thread management, among others.
- `QtWidgets` and `QtGui`: This module contains classes for calling widgets. Widgets are the components that make up the majority of a graphical interface. These include buttons, textboxes, and labels.
- `QtWebkit`: This module makes it possible to use web pages and apps within a Qt application.
- `QtNetwork`: This module provides classes to connect to and communicate with network resources.
- `QtXML`: For parsing XML documents, this module contains useful classes.
- `QtSQL`: This module is feature-rich with classes and drivers that allow for connecting to databases, including My SQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
